### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm proud nerd, code addicted with a strong passion for videogame and software development.ðŸ‘¾ 

I design and architect Web and Mobile Applications, providing guidelines and best practices and mentoring rookie developers. 
My focus is writing scalable, secure, readable and performing code.

I like to work in a agile/scrum team, using A/B testing and data analysis to design and evolve the product's user experience. I'm an avid reader and naturally curious. Inspired by the desire to develop products to improve people's live. I constantly study and train to improve my development skills.
